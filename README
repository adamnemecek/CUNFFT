CUNFFT - Nonequispaced FFT and it's inversion in CUDA

Overview
--------
CUNFFT is written in CUDA and based on the NFFT3,a software library written in C 
for computing nonequispaced fast Fourier and related transformations. 
In detail, CUNFFT implements

 1) The nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (CUNFFT)
    - the forward transform (CUNFFT)
    - the adjoint transform (adjoint CUNFFT)

For an introduction, please read the "NFFT 3.0 - Tutorial" first. It is
available in the subdirectory doc/tutorial/tutorial.pdf. Detailed API
documentation can be found in HTML format in /doc/api/html/index.html
or in LaTeX format for self compilation in /doc/api/latex/refman.tex.
For installation instructions, you can also refer to the file INSTALL
in this directory.

The most current general paper, and the one that we recommend if you wish
to cite NFFT, is: The paper by Keiner, J., Kunis, S., and Potts, D.
